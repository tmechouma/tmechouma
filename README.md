## About Me

A highly skilled NLP expert and passionate AI researcher, driven by a mission to design and develop state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (LLMs) that transcend symbolic surface forms to semotize concepts—capturing meaning through grounded, perceptual representations. My research vision lies in bridging the gap between linguistic symbols and real-world semantics by fusing vision and language at the conceptual level, creating truly intelligent systems that understand, reason, and interact like humans.

I integrate cutting-edge technologies including Transformers, LLMs variants, GNNs, and powerful toolkits like LangChain, Semantic Kernel, Haystack, LiteLLM, and LlamaIndex to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and intelligent agents capable of real-world problem solving. My multimodal pipeline involves CLIP, BLIP-2, Kosmos-2, and Flamingo, tightly woven with language processing layers to enable deep contextual understanding across text, image, and video modalities.

With hands-on expertise in vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus), I implement semantic indexing and grounded concept linking using external knowledge bases and latent spaces derived from vision models—an approach that redefines the nature of understanding and inference in AI.

Proficient in Python, Spark, SQL, and modern DevOps/MLOps practices (Docker, GitHub Actions, MLflow, Terraform, Kubernetes), I deploy scalable, production-ready AI services in Azure, GCP, and AWS cloud ecosystems. My architecture philosophy embraces CI/CD, data-centric AI, and research-to-deployment alignment, ensuring that cutting-edge insights seamlessly translate into enterprise-grade solutions.

An enthusiastic collaborator and lifelong learner, I thrive at the intersection of research and application, constantly pushing the frontiers of multimodal cognition, grounded meaning, and neurosymbolic AI. I’m on a mission to contribute to the next generation of LLMs that can see, reason, and communicate with conceptual depth—not just linguistic fluency.
